//Let's start the Skyscraper puzzle again, using these new guidelines:
//Do not use if loops, instead use while loops.
// No other functions allowed other than malloc and free

// Use the following functions:

int ft_clue_init()
{
    //initialise the clues that are parsed in by Main
}

int ft_put_num()
{
    //Function to write numbers
}

int ft_grid_init()
{
// Initialize grid
// Loop to write numbers
// Make sure numbers unique, 1234 both column and row
}


int ft_check_col()
{
    //Check columns top to down and down to top for number of buildings visible
    //Set number of buildings in variable is_visible
    //If is_visible = clue , then move on to next square
    //If is_visible != clue, then loop to "brute force" until it is ==
}

int ft_check_row()
{
    //Check row left to right and right to left for number of buildings visible
    //Set number of buildings in variable is_visible
    //If is_visible = clue , then move on to next square
    //If is_visible != clue, then loop to "brute force" until it is ==
}

int ft_solve()
{
    //write new 4x4 grid with correct answers
}
